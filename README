iir_fixed_point
===============

This is a very compact fixed point 2nd order IIR filter implementation.

The data and coefficients are short int and the accumulator
is int.

The coefficients need to be scaled up by 2^q and then the filter
scales them back by a bitshift. The argument q in the constructor
tells the filter how many bits need to be shaved off to obtain the
unscaled result.

Just the header file 'DirectFormI.h' needs to be included and then the
filter can be used. The constructor sets the coefficients and tells
the filter the scaling factor q of the coefficients as a power of 2.
The filtering method is called "filter" and takes one short int sample
and outputs a short int sample.

Check out the demo file which also contains the octave commands to
generate the filter coefficients.

To run the demo:

make

./fixeddemo

gnuplot

> plot "ecg_filtered.dat" with lines
