iir_fixed_point
===============

This is a compact fixed point 2nd order IIR filter implementation.

The data and coefficients are short int types and the accumulator
is of type int.

The coefficients need to be scaled up by 2^q and then the filter
scales its output back with a bitshift after every time step. q is the
last argument in the constructor. The easiest approach is to multiply
the original floating point coeffcients by (1<<q) in the constructor
of the filter and then the constructor converts them into short ints
automatically.

Useage: Just the header file 'DirectFormI.h' needs to be included in
your code. There are no library files to be included. The constructor
sets the coefficients (a_x are the feedback coefficients and b_x the
feedforward ones) and tells the filter the scaling factor 2^q of the
coefficients:
        b_0 + b_1 z^-1 + b_2 z^-2
H(z) = ---------------------------
        1 + a_1 z^-1 + a_2 z^-2

The filtering method is called "filter" which takes one
short int sample and outputs a short int sample and takes care
of the scaling.

The filter is explained in detail in this youTube playlist:

Check out the demo file which also contains the octave commands to
generate the filter coefficients for a bandstop filter.

To run the demo:

make

./fixeddemo

gnuplot

> plot "ecg_filtered.dat" with lines

Enjoy!
